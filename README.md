# Machine Learning project on Road Segmentation

Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning viewed in the lectures to find road on satellite pictures.
The documentation to any method can be found in the corresponding file accordingly to PEP 257.
You can also access it though a python2/3 shell after importing it using `help(file.function)`.

## Functionalities

### Find the best linear result obtained
- In a shell go in the directory ML_Project2/src
- Create a new `.py`file
- Import the package `tools.linear_model`
- Use the different methods to obtain the best results obtained with the logistic regression, Ridge and the Baysian Ridge

## Methods:

### Classification package

### Keras-Segnet package

### Model package

### Reader package

### Tools package

### Unet package
